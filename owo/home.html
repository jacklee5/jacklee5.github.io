<h1>Wewcome!</h1>
No matter how you got onto this site, you may be wondering:

    <li>What is OwOsuppwiew?</li>
    <li>Why am I wasting my time here?</li>

<h2>What is an OwOsuppwiew?</h2>
Well first, OwOsuppwiew is a bot on discord, written on discord.py. It's functions are not many. In fact, all it can do is owo-ify messages. Oh, and make faces. Yea... it sounds pretty unimpressive, but in my defense, this was made in my limited free time, and is probably the reason I failed my last math test. Despite my time for working on this bot is limited, I'm still open to suggestions and bug reports. You can tell me about anything that needs to be fixed on this server: <a href = "https://discord.gg/2dNdGRE">https://discord.gg/2dNdGRE</a>.
<h2>Why did you even come here?</h2>
Next, if you're asking why you're here, I really don't know. To be completely honest, I don't know who decided it was a good idea to refer to this useless bot. Nevertheless, if you want to go ahead and add OwO to your server, use this nice bitly link: <a href = "https://bit.ly/owoinvite">https://bit.ly/owoinvite</a>
